We have implemented a multi-agent infrastructure using the beliefs-desires-intention model. The agents are
capable of planning by themselves and a central unit merges the plans of the different agents when possible,
otherwise agents request other agents to help them or recompute new plans if necessary.

The results have shown that the system can resolve all three types of maps: FOSA, FOMA and POMA. The
performance on the first is good, although some improvements might be necessary to resolve complex scenarios.
