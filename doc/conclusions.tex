We have implemented a multi-agent infrastructure using the Beliefs-Desires-Intention model. The agents are
capable of planning by themselves using various optimizations and techniques. A central unit then merges the
plans of the different agents when possible, otherwise agents request other agents to help them or recompute
new plans if necessary.

The results have shown that the system can resolve all three types of maps: FOSA, FOMA and POMA. The
performance on the first type is very good, although some heuristics improvements might be necessary to
resolve some complex scenarios. For the multi-agent maps, due to the plan merging and conflict resolution
methods, the system has great results with near-optimal solutions for situations with a fewer number of
agents, but can be improved for other situations.
