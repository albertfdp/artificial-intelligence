Our implementation of the system allows anyone interested to easily add new heuristics, goal types or other
types of algorithms. Thus, after careful analyses or new observations, the system can be easily tweaked to
take into consideration new situations.

The most important aspect that can be improved in the case of our implementation is the plan merging conflict
resolution. In situations where the plans of more than two agents generate conflicts during the merging
process, the current implementation still lacks a strong way of resolution so improvements can be made.

Other aspects that can always be improved in artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems are the way
heuristics are computed and goal picking. Moreover, more low-level optimizations can be done in the core part
of the implementation for faster computations and better access to resources.
