This report aims to present an approach to a multi-agent system. The goal was to create a multi-agent system
in which agents have to transport boxes on goal cells by pushing or pulling them. This report analyses the
problems that might appear when dealing with such a situation and presents our solution, focusing on our
results and findings.

We have implemented a multi-agent system for a problem-specific domain, which uses hierarchical planning and
forward state search. The result is satisfactory, with the system behaving well in most of the maps that were
used for testing. However, with more work in the heuristics part, even better results can be achieved.
% still need to "Tease" a bit about the findings. Maybe after we've written them..%
