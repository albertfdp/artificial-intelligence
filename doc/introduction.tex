This report aims to present an approach to a multi-agent system. The goal was to create a multi-agent system in which agents had to transport boxes on goal cells by pushing or pulling them. This report analyses the problem and presents our solution, focusing on our results and findings.

We have implemented a multi-agent system for a problem-specific domain, which uses hierarchical planning and forward state search. The result is satisfactory, with the system behaving well in most of the maps that were used for testing. However, with more work in the heuristics part, even better results could be achieved.
%still need to "Tease" a bit about the findings. Maybe after we've written them..%
